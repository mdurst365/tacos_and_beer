# Tacos and Beer App

## About this project

This is a homework project for the OSU coding bootcamp. It is an app that generates a random beer and a random taco and suggests them as a combination. If the user likes the combo, they can save it to their favorites in local storage. The general idea is to make a call from at least two seperate server-side APIs, create an interactive interface and to include a CSS framework other than Bootstrap (in this case I chose Bulma).
