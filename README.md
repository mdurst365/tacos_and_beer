# Project 1 - Tacos and Beer

## About this project

This project was created as a homework assignment for the OSU coding bootcamp. It requires a responsive interface, the use of at least two server-side APIs, the use of client-side storage and the use of a CSS framework other than Bootstrap (I chose Bulma). 

This is an app for taco and beer lovers, with the click of a button they get the name of a random taco and the name of a random beer as a suggested combo. If the user likes the combo then the user can save it to their favorites in local storage.
